Naming issues: try to name functions with capital letters. "IdentifyOperators" instead of "identifyOperators"
Sometimes infinite recursion in identifyOperators function, so app crash with StackOverflowException
TextBox should be not editable, or should filter input. Typing character symbols leads to crash
Nice usage of same event handler for multiple buttons
Nice usage of incapsulating logic to separate functions
